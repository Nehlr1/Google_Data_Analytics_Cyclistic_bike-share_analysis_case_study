# Google_Data_Analytics_Cyclistic_bike-share_analysis_case_study


The case study analyzes the data of a fictional bike-sharing company called Cyclistic and aims to understand how customers are using their bikes differently between the months of June and July, particularly with respect to casual riders and members. The project involves various stages of data analysis including data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation of the findings.

The repository contains all the necessary files such as the dataset used, the code written in R language for the analysis, and a final report summarizing the findings of the case study. The project provides insights into how bike-sharing companies can optimize their services by understanding the needs and behavior of their customers.
